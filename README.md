# Introduction:
In this repo, I learned about Agile iterative planning. How to create good user stories, estimate and assign story points, build and refine a product backlog, and build a sprint plan. 
This repo describes the daily workflow for executing a sprint plan, including how to determine which story to work on and how to keep the team updated on progress. I learned what a daily stand-up is and how to run one. I learned how to use burndown charts to forecast the team’s ability to achieve the sprint goal. I learned how to conduct the sprint review and the sprint retrospective. And I found out how to measure success and use actionable metrics to improve the team’s performance.

## Learning Objectives:
- Describe the sprint planning process.
- Explain how to build and refine the backlog.
- Describe a good user story.
- Define a kanban board and explain how work flows across the board as it is completed.
- Articulate why iterative planning is more accurate than up-front planning.
- Discuss Scrum anti-patterns and how to measure the health of a scrum team.
- Explain how to use metrics to effectively measure and improve a team’s performance.
- Describe sprint meetings and how to conduct them.
- Explain how to use a burndown chart to help forecast the ability to achieve a sprint goal.
- Describe the daily workflow, including the daily stand-up meeting.

## Lab Agile Planning (project)
This repository contains the lab for agile planning Learning Objectives mentioned in the previous section.

## Agile Final Project (project)
This Final Project is mandatory for learners who will be practitioners and are pursuing the [IBM DevOps and Software Engineering Professional Certificate](https://www.edx.org/certificates/professional-certificate/ibm-devops-and-software-engineering?index=product&queryID=6fb5f3bdb1661a739ae1c9bd6d087185&position=2&results_level=first-level-results&term=IBM+DevOps+Professional+Certificate&objectID=program-8ff977cd-9187-4822-8d28-77b8561db968&campaign=DevOps+and+Software+Engineering&source=edX&product_category=professional-certificate&placement_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.edx.org%2Fsearch).

### Overview
In this project, I created an Agile plan with Kanban board. I wrote user stories, built and refined the product backlog, built a sprint plan, moved stories on the kanban board, set up a burndown chart, and got ready for the next sprint.

Now that you have been equipped with the knowledge and skills to create sprint plans, you will have the opportunity in this final project to practice and apply it by creating stories, assembling them into a product backlog, refining them to produce a sprint plan, and perform a mock sprint that involves moving stories across your kanban board as your team would do in a real sprint.

### Final project scenario
In this scenario, we played the roles of a product owner, scrum master, and developer. As a product owner, We created stories for team and organize these stories into a product backlog. As a scrum master, you will create a sprint milestone and ensure that a subset of the stories is ready to be placed in a sprint plan. As a developer, you will create the sprint backlog and execute some of the stories by moving them across the kanban board in a simulated sprint.

Our team has been tasked with developing the back-end product catalog for an e-commerce website. Stakeholders require the ability to create, retrieve, update, and delete products from the catalog, along with features like indicating product likes and hosting on a cloud environment with automated deployments.

Our team will use a kanban board to create a backlog and sprint plan for this work. As the product owner, you will drive the process by leveraging the skills learned in the lessons and labs to create a new GitHub repository and kanban board and fill the kanban board with issues that will become user stories.
